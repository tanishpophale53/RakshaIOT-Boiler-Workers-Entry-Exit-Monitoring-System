# RakshaIOT-Boiler-Workers-Entry-Exit-Monitoring-System

RakshaiOT is an IoT-based product which is meticulously designed to safeguard the lives of workers during Boiler Maintenance in Thermal Power Plants and similar environments. With safety as the top priority, we have crafted a system that offers real-time monitoring, live alerts, and proactive corrective actions to prevent potential hazards. It is a product that automatically monitors workers and logs their entry and exit statuses on a Web portal-based dashboard.

Organizations spend a lot of money on safety equipment and devices. The projects main area of focus is the boiler maintenance. Only authorized workers are permitted to work in confined spaces inside the boilers. Confined spaces are always low in oxygen or may contain hazardous gases. A human may not be able to stay and work inside the boiler for a longer time period. The organization has to maintain a manual ledger for tracking authorized entries. Due to manual intervention, the door to errors is always open. A single error can result in a significant loss, which can be a human. 

So, to address the above problem, RakshaIOT project is built using Python, Linux, SQL, Shell Scripting and Raspberry PI.
